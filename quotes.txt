Music is the wine which inspires one to new generative processes, and I am Bacchus who presses out this glorious wine for mankind and makes them spiritually drunken.
Only the pure in heart can make a good soup. 
Only Pure Music should strike fire from the heart of man, and bring tears from the eyes of woman. 
Music comes to me more readily than words.
I must confess that I lead a miserable life. For almost two years, I have ceased to attend any social functions, just because I find it impossible to say to people, 'I am deaf.' If I had any other profession, I might be able to cope with my infirmity; but in my profession, it is a terrible handicap. 
I Am Impossible 
Nothing is more intolerable than to have to admit to yourself your own errors. 
Applaud my friends, the comedy is over.
Applaud What you are, you are by accident of birth; what I am, I am by myself. There are and will be a thousand princes; there is only one Beethoven. 
To play without passion is inexcusable! 
Beethoven can write music, thank God, but he can do nothing else on earth. 
Music is a higher revelation than philosophy.
Music is like a dream. One that I cannot hear.
Never forget the days I spent with you. Continue to be my friend, as you will always find me yours
I shall seize fate by the throat.

Love demands all, and has a right to all.
A great poet is the most precious jewel of a nation.
Music is the mediator between the spiritual and sensual life
Even in poverty I lived like a king for I tell you that nobility is the thing that makes a king
Life would be flat without music. It is the background to all I do. It speaks to the heart in its own special way like nothing else.
An artist is someone who has learned to trust in himself.
I have never thought of writing for reputation and honor. What I have in my heart must come out; that is the reason why I compose.
Hide your secret even from the closest friend; learn to be silent.
Do you think I give a damn about your and your pathetic violin?
